## Use case

You are a developer working on your own or on a small team. To stay organized and keep yourself (and your team) organized, you like to create issue tickets in github. However, you find yourself spending a lot of time writing these tickets, and sometimes you're not sure else should be done.

issue-helper will take a look at your code base and help you craft the issue tickets you need to work on. It will also (in a later phase) help you create well-balanced milestones in github.

## Planning

#### Core functionality and proof of concept (works for already indexed repo)
- [ ] Find accessibility concerns in repo
- [ ] Select which concerns you would like to address
- [ ] Generate issue breakdowns
- [ ] User can make changes to text before creating the issue in github.

#### Add in other kinds of issues
- [ ] Bugs
- [ ] New Features
- [ ] ??

#### Phase 2 (allow user to index repo in the app)

- [ ] User can select any repo to index, in app
- [ ] Track index progress (can take a long time)
